In the world of academia and software development, there's often an unspoken pressure to constantly innovate and create something entirely new. While innovation is undoubtedly crucial for progress, there's equal importance in recognizing and leveraging the wealth of existing knowledge, methodologies, and tools available.

As the saying goes, "good writers borrow, great writers steal outright." This notion applies aptly to both academia and software development. Instead of reinventing the wheel with every project, there's immense value in borrowing ideas, techniques, and even code from existing sources.

Take, for example, the approach of Ramnath Vaidyanathan, a master at blending existing tools to create remarkable software solutions. By building slidify on top of knitr and rCharts on top of existing D3 libraries, he demonstrated how leveraging existing resources can lead to the creation of powerful tools without the need to solve every problem from scratch.

In academia, the pressure to be "new" and "innovative" can sometimes overshadow the pragmatic approach of building upon existing research and methodologies. However, embracing this approach can lead to more efficient progress and breakthroughs.

Similarly, in software development, the principle of minimizing dependencies and keeping things simple reigns supreme. It's crucial to carefully consider the necessity of each feature and avoid adding unnecessary complexity. By focusing on creating exactly enough functionality to meet users' needs without overwhelming them with extraneous features, developers can create more maintainable and user-friendly software.

One area where this principle often comes into play is in the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and Shiny apps. While these tools may seem appealing for enhancing user interaction, they can introduce significant complexity and maintenance challenges. It's essential to weigh the benefits of such features against their long-term implications, particularly in terms of reproducibility and maintenance overhead.

Moreover, separating concerns by placing GUIs and Shiny apps into separate packages can help maintain the focus and simplicity of the core software while still providing options for users who prefer a more interactive interface.

Ultimately, the key takeaway is the importance of pragmatism in both academia and software development. By recognizing the value of existing resources, minimizing dependencies, and focusing on simplicity, academics and developers alike can create more efficient, maintainable, and impactful solutions.

In a world that often glorifies novelty and complexity, sometimes the greatest achievements come from building upon what already exists. So let's embrace the wisdom of leveraging existing tools and knowledge, for it is in this approach that true progress lies.

I am creating a comprehensive and detailed history of the conflict that goes beyond the surface-level events. By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth's history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.
