# Welcome to my website, I'm Sakshi Gautam Pandit!

I aspire to embark on a career path as a Data Analyst and Systems Consultant within the healthcare domain. My goal is to apply my problem-solving abilities towards creating pathways that leverage data for enhancing diagnosis, patient care, and sustainable business solutions. Eventually, I envision overseeing operations within and beyond hospitals, from patient consultations to orchestrating external conferences.

My educational foundation includes a Diploma in Strategic Design and Management with Distinction from the ISDI School of Design and Innovation in Mumbai, India, alongside a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology with Distinction from the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), University of Mumbai. At present, I am a Master's of Science candidate, specializing in Bio-medical & Health Informatics.

Driven by a passion for harnessing data for positive change in healthcare, I'm equipped with a diverse skill set, practical experience, and a commitment to continual learning. I'm excited to contribute my expertise and drive to your organization's success in transforming healthcare through data-driven insights and innovative solutions.
