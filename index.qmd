# Welcome to my website!

I aspire to embark on a career path as a Data Analyst and Systems Consultant within the healthcare domain. My goal is to apply my problem-solving abilities towards creating pathways that leverage data for enhancing diagnosis, patient care, and sustainable business solutions. Eventually, I envision overseeing operations within and beyond hospitals, from patient consultations to orchestrating external conferences.

My undergraduate journey in Strategic Design and Management equipped me with a unique blend of design, business, and management skills. Key courses like Research and Development Methods, Service Design, and Strategic Management laid a strong groundwork.

Driven by a passion for harnessing data for positive change in healthcare, I'm equipped with a diverse skill set, practical experience, and a commitment to continual learning. I'm excited to contribute my expertise and drive to your organization's success in transforming healthcare through data-driven insights and innovative solutions.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:sakshigautam1500@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
